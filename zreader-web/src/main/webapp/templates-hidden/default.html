      If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
    network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
    get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
    interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
    of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
    solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
    specific requirements.

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
